Engineering A World Free From Unwanted Sound

<img src="https://i-ince.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iince-logo-1.png" width="300" alt="i-ince-logo">

The International Institute of Noise Control Engineering (I-INCE) was founded in 1974. It is a worldwide consortium of organizations concerned with noise control, acoustics and vibration. The primary focus of the Institute is on unwanted sounds and on vibrations producing such sounds when transduced.

I-INCE is the only organization that has a worldwide coverage of the issue of noise control technology. It has the ability to identify global noise control issues, discuss them on a global scale and communicate its findings with nearly all nations in the world. In the present connected world this might be a unique position that brings opportunities but also responsibilities.

### [EURASIP - European Association For Signal Processing](https://eurasip.org/)
<a id="markdown-eurasip---european-association-for-signal-processing" name="eurasip---european-association-for-signal-processing"></a>

<img src="https://eurasip.org/main/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/logo.png" width="100" alt="eurasip-logo">

The European Association for Signal Processing (EURASIP) was founded in 1978 with the purpose / objective of improving communication between groups and individuals that work within the multidisciplinary field of signal processing in Europe and elsewhere, exchanging and disseminating information in the field of signal processing, and furthering the efforts of researchers by providing a learned and professional platform for dissemination and discussion of all aspects of signal processing, without aiming at generating profit or any other material advantage whatsoever.

In 2006, EURASIP was established as a non-profit organization under Belgian law (“vereniging zonder winstoogmerk (VZW)”, registration number 0885.447.771) having its registered office in Belgium. EURASIP VZW is hence a legal entity, as outlined in its statutes, and is represented by its so-called General Assembly. The General Assembly is a group of individuals (mostly founding members and former Directors) that oversee the decisions and actions of the BoD (see below), approves the annual account and budget, appoints Directors, and discharges Directors from liability.

The general governance of the Association is in the hands of the Board of Directors (BoD), that is composed of 7 voting and 1 non-voting (Past-President) Directors. The Directors are appointed by the General Assembly after an indicate vote by the EURASIP Members. Directors typically serve a 3-year term that is once renewable. The BoD is headed by the EURASIP President, who is appointed by the BoD for a non-renewable 3-year term. The day-to-day governance of the Association is managed by the Executive Committee, consisting of the EURASIP President, the EURASIP Director for Finances and Operations, and the EURASIP Office Manager.

[Aims and scope](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-sound-and-vibration/about/aims-and-scope)

The Journal of Sound and Vibration (JSV) is an independent journal devoted to the prompt publication of original papers, both theoretical and experimental, that communicates new knowledge or reviews on important aspects of sound or vibration. There is an emphasis on fundamental work that has potential for practical application within a wider context than the specific situation reported.

JSV was founded and operates on the premise that the subject of sound and vibration requires a journal that publishes papers of a high technical standard across the various subdisciplines, thus facilitating awareness of techniques and discoveries in one area that may be applicable in others.

Papers published in JSV should contain new insights of value to the acoustics and vibration community.

Scope

The IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing is dedicated to innovative theory and methods for processing signals representing audio, speech and language, and their applications. This includes analysis, synthesis, enhancement, transformation, classification and interpretation of such signals as well as the design, development, and evaluation of associated signal processing systems.

Machine learning and pattern analysis applied to any of the above areas is also welcome.
Reproducible research

The Transactions encourages authors to make their publications reproducible by making all information needed to reproduce the presented results available online. This typically requires publishing the code and data used to produce the publication's figures and tables on a website; see the supplemental materials section of the information for authors. It gives other researchers easier access to the work, and facilitates fair comparisons.
Multimedia content

It is now possible to submit for review and publish in Xplore supporting multimedia material such as speech samples, images, movies, matlab code etc. A multimedia graphical abstract can also be displayed along with the traditional text. More information is available under Multimedia Materials at the IEEE Author Center.

#### [Scope](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-signal-processing-letters/about-sp-letters)
<a id="markdown-scope" name="scope"></a>

The IEEE Signal Processing Letters is a monthly, archival publication designed to provide rapid dissemination of original, cutting-edge ideas and timely, significant contributions in signal, image, speech, language and audio processing. Papers published in the Letters can be presented within one year of their appearance in signal processing conferences such as ICASSP, GlobalSIP and ICIP, and also in several workshop organized by the Signal Processing Society.

Archival format

A Signal Processing Letter is a five pages long paper, in the two column version, comprising at most four pages of technical content plus one page only for references. The journal can be edited with the same formatting guidelines as those used for the Transactions, except for the length of the paper that is much shorter. The lean format of the IEEE Signal Processing Letters is meant to promote ideas not sacrifice rigor. Supplementary material (up to one page) that is included in IEEExplore can include mathematical proofs and additional references that are not immediately necessary to follow the flow of the paper. It can also be used to aid the reproduction of the numerical results (an additional one page).

Reproducible research

The Transactions encourages authors to make their publications reproducible by making all information needed to reproduce the presented results available online. This typically requires publishing the code and data used to produce the publication`s figures and tables on a website; see the supplemental materials section of the information for authors. It gives other researchers easier access to the work, and facilitates fair comparisons.

20世纪70年代，中科院东海研究站组织了一些科技人员，对当时国外水声科技前沿的学术论文进行翻译，以便内部学习交流，经上海市科委同意，出版了《水声译丛》内部刊物。

1980年上海市声学学会成立。为开展学术交流，经协商，决定将《水声译丛》(图1)作为上海市声学学会的会刊，更名为《声学技术》(季刊)，主办单位为中科院东海研究站、同济大学声学研究所和上海市声学学会，编辑部设在中科院东海研究站，并向上海市有关部门申请变更事宜。

1982年6月1日《声学技术》创刊号(图2)出版，内容涉及水声、超声、生物医学超声、海洋声学技术以及建筑声学等领域，受到了广大声学工作者的欢迎。经过4年的努力，在1985年8月，《声学技术》获准在国内外公开出版发行。

1997年，中船重工集团第七二六研究所加盟办刊，《声学技术》成为中科院东海研究站、同济大学声学研究所、上海市声学学会和中船重工集团第七二六研究所4家单位合办的学术性刊物(季刊)。2006年起由季刊改为双月刊(图3)。

目前，《声学技术》已被美国《乌利希期刊指南》(Ulrich PD,Ulrich's Periodicals Directory)、波兰《哥白尼索引》(IC, Index of Copurnicus)、美国剑桥科学文摘社(CSA)、英国《科学文摘》(INSPEC)数据库收录；是《中国科学引文数据库》、《中国学术期刊综合评价数据库》来源期刊；是中国科技论文统计源期刊《中国科技核心期刊》；被《中国核心期刊(遴选)数据库》收录；在“万方数据-数字化期刊群”全文上网。并由《中国学术期刊(光盘版)》和《中国期刊网》全文收录，并入编《中文核心期刊要目总览》(2004、2014、2017、2020版)。

《声学技术》的办刊宗旨是：在声学专业领域内进行科研、技术交流；开展学术讨论与评述；介绍国内外新技术和新产品；促进声学事业的发展，并为声学科研、生产和教学人员知识创新服务。专业范围包括：超声学、生物医学超声学、电声学、水声学、海洋声学技术、建筑声学、噪声控制、生理和心理声学、声信号处理、换能器和声系统等。
